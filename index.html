                            Greetings! My name is Marlon Umeadi, and I'm an underwriter at Regions bank. The primary
                            role of an
                            underwriter is to utilize consumer lending laws and policies to make decisions on home
                            equity loan
                            applications. Prior to being an underwriter, I had the advantage of working in the front
                            office.
                            Underwriting is a back office role, so my background has given me a unique exposure to both
                            sides of
                            the bank. Banking and finance are vast worlds that are constantly evolving. This makes
                            maintaining a
                            presense in the digital age a top priority for financial institutions.

                            One of my goals from this bootcamp is to combine my background in finance with web
                            development. I'm
                            hoping this will allow me to transition into a role that allows me to tap into my
                            creativity. When
                            I'm not underwriting applications, and sharpening my web development skills I'm a dad of 13
                            houseplants. I also like to stay physically active with yoga, boxing, and calisthenics. I
                            instruct
                            calisthenics classes 3 days a week during the warmer months. Upon completion of the Trilogy
                            Code
                            Bootcamp, I plan on delving more into my yoga practice.
